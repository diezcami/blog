# Biography
Iâ€™m a 20 year old university student taking up Computer Science in Manila. I love learning, building and doing just about anything with code. My favourite language is Go, which I use primarily to build my side projects alongside the iOS apps I develop in my spare time. If I'm not coding, I'm probably studying for my university classes, tinkering with my gadgets or taking a few [photos](http://diezcami.vsco.co).

# Skills
I use Go, C++, Java and Python regularly in the context of general coding for my school work and open source contributions. I also use Swift daily in the context of iOS/OS X development, and am capable of designing, building and optimising apps. I'm also proficient in other programming languages and frameworks (particularly involving front-end and back-end development), though I don't use them on a daily basis. I'm also highly flexible with my work requirements, and am capable of quickly adapting to and learning new languages and frameworks.
