Iâ€™m a 20 year old university student taking up Computer Science in Manila. While I'm most experienced working on the back end with C++ and Java, I also like doing front end development with Ruby and drafting UI/UX designs on the side. When I'm not coding, you might find me hanging out with my dog, reading, painting or studying in a cafe.

Here, I write on topics related to programming, development, open source and anything related to my line of work. Everything on this website except the actual content is open source under the MIT license - you can grab the source code [here](https://github.com/diezcami/blog).
