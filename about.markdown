Iâ€™m a 20 year old university student taking up Computer Science in Manila, and I like coding. While I mostly program back-end logic in C++ and Java, I also like doing simple front-end designs on the side. My interests outside programming include painting, playing the piano, and reading.

Here, I write on topics related to programming, development, open source and anything related to my line of work. Everything on this website except the actual content is open source under the MIT license - you can grab the source code [here](https://github.com/diezcami/blog).
