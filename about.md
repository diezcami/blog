Iâ€™m a 20 year old university student taking up Computer Science in Manila, and write most of my code in C++ and Java. My interests outside programming include painting, playing the piano, and reading . I also happen to love dogs, especially my own - a beagle named Lou, and a corgi named Mikki.

If you'd like to learn more about me and my projects, you can visit my portfolio at http://diezcami.github.io.

Here, I'll be writing on topics such as software development, general programming and UNIX tweaks.
