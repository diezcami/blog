It's difficult to get really into programming without ongoing projects or a proper job. The latter's impossible due to my taking 24 units this semester as well as company culture in Manila; the former, however, just somehow feels ridiculously out of reach.

When summer started in late March, I found myself studying topics independent of each other, while struggling to come up with ideas for a concrete project. I did learn a lot in that span of time, but I can't say programming without a proper direction or end goal for so long was good for my personal motivation and sense of productivity. Predictably, I got burnt out and refused to read or do anything related to programming. I went to Hong Kong in June for my [study abroad term](http://diezcami.vsco.co), and did not code outside the scope of my classes throughout the duration of my stay.

I got back from my term abroad a week ago, and have been taking up classes at my home university since then. While my semester's packed, I'm hoping to be able to come up with project ideas to build up my resume in time for my summer internship next year. 

I guess the key to not getting burnt out is to approach programming not as something to learn or conquer, but as a way of building ideas into something concrete. Either way, I'm in a somewhat appropriate mentality for programming again, and am hoping to ship something relevant soon.
